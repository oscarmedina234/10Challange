# 10Challenge SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This command application is to build a simple svg logo that uses inquire to prompt the user for text, text color, shape, and shape color. I learned how to use inquire and how to build a svg file using the answers from the prompt. There is also a testing file using jest to check the shape render class. Also learned how to use jest and how to write tests.
